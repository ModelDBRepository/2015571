This is the readme for the simulation showing the generation of burst discharges by blockade of K channels in the distal axons. 
This burst activity is possibly triggered ectopically from distal axons, since action potentials at the distal axons preceded the somatic action potentials during the burst. 
Antidromic propagation invades soma and caused spikelet due to impedance mismatch from axon to soma, which converted to full spike if sonatic gNa was increased.

To run the simulations, follow these steps:
- Compile the mod files using `nrnivmodl` under any platform, or optionally `mknrndll` under Windows.
- Run `mosinit.hoc` in NEURON.
- Click the buttons and radiobuttons in the panel "Demo" and click "Init & Run" in the "RunControl" panel to run simulations.
